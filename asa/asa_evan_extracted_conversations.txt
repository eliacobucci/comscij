Hey Joseph, I've been following this conversation and I'm curious about something. Asa here do you think we could extend this to analyze group dynamics as well?
That's an interesting question, Asa. I think the same mathematical principles could apply to group formation. What's your intuition about how multiple self-concepts might interact?
Well, as Evan mentioned earlier in our lab meeting, we might see interference patterns between individual self-concepts. I think the group dynamics could be modeled using the same Hebbian principles.

Asa: Asa here I've been analyzing the data from our previous experiments, and I think we're seeing some interesting patterns in the cross-linguistic results.
Joseph: That's excellent work, Asa. Your analysis of the cultural patterns is quite sophisticated. What specific patterns are you noticing?
Asa: Well, I'm seeing stronger self-concept formation in individualistic languages compared to collectivistic ones, just as the theory predicts. The mass accumulation ratios support our hypotheses.

Evan here actually, my analysis suggests we should be careful about assuming interference patterns. The mathematical structure might support constructive rather than destructive interactions between self-concepts.
