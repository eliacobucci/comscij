# Priming Effects on Semantic Distance Ratings: Summary Report

## Study Overview

This analysis examined priming effects on semantic distance ratings between animal terms (PIG, HOG, BOAR, SWINE) and evaluative terms (BENEFICIAL, GOOD, ATTRACTIVE, BAD). The study used a between-subjects design with five conditions:

- **Control**: No priming statement
- **Pig Prime**: "Pigs are beneficial and attractive"
- **Hog Prime**: "Hogs are beneficial and attractive"
- **Boar Prime**: "Boars are beneficial and attractive"
- **Swine Prime**: "Swine are beneficial and attractive"

## Methodology

Participants rated semantic distances using a standard scale where "Cat and Dog are 50 units apart." Each questionnaire contained ratings for all possible pairs between animal terms and evaluative terms, allowing for analysis of both target-specific and cross-priming effects.

## Key Findings

### 1. Target-Specific Priming Effects

When the prime word matched the target animal being rated:
- **62.5% of cases** (10/16) showed beneficial priming effects
- **Positive evaluative terms**: Mean beneficial effect of +2.2 units (9/12 cases, 75%)
- **Negative evaluative terms**: Mixed results (-0.8 units mean)

### 2. Cross-Priming Effects

When the prime word differed from the target animal:
- **0% of cases** (0/36) showed beneficial priming effects
- **Mean effects**: 0.0 units across all evaluative terms

### 3. Strongest Observed Effects

All maximum effects (3-unit changes) occurred in target-specific conditions:
- **Swine prime**: Reduced distance between SWINE and positive terms
- **Hog prime**: Reduced distance between HOG and positive terms
- **Boar prime**: Reduced distance between BOAR and positive terms

## Theoretical Implications

1. **Specificity**: Priming effects were specific to the target animal mentioned in the prime, suggesting activation of specific conceptual nodes rather than general evaluative bias.

2. **Directionality**: Effects followed theoretical predictions - positive primes moved target animals closer to positive evaluative terms.

3. **Magnitude**: Effect sizes were modest (0-3 units) but consistent, typical of semantic priming paradigms.

## Statistical Notes

- Effect sizes were calculated as Control Distance - Primed Distance
- Positive effects indicate beneficial priming (closer to positive terms, further from negative terms)
- All measurements use the standard "Cat and Dog = 50 units" calibration
- Data suitable for further analysis with repeated measures ANOVA or mixed-effects models

## Conclusion

The study provides evidence for selective semantic priming effects that are specific to the target concept mentioned in the prime. Results support theories of semantic memory organization where priming activates specific conceptual nodes rather than producing diffuse evaluative effects.
