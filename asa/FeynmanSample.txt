Feynman:
You start by interrupting me with a question.
Weiner:
That’s right. It saves interruption later. Let’s talk about the earliest recollections you have
of your family, your neighborhood and your home.
Feynman:
Nothing scientific, just a simple —? I don’t know what to say. That’s a hard one. I have
lots of recollections, little bits and pieces.
Weiner:
Let me ask where you lived in Far Rockaway, was this —?
Feynman:
I was born somewhere in New York, but I don’t remember anything except Far
Rockaway, and then we went for some time, I remember, to a house in a place called
Baldwin, on Long Island, where I think we lived a year or a half a year or a summer. And
then, sometime after Far Rockaway, we went to live in Cedarhurst, but then by that time
I was nine or eleven. Then we came back to Far Rockaway again. That gives an outline
of where things were.
Weiner:
When you have recollections of Far Rockaway, what sort of a neighborhood was it?
Feynman:4
There were these two periods, the first and the second. The first time I can’t remember
very well at all. I remember moving to the house. We walked along. It was a big house.
We lived there with my cousins, a cousin family, I mean — my mother’s sisters. The two
families lived together in a big, rather large house, with a big garden. We had a couple, a
man and a woman, who took care of it. I can’t remember which period exactly. But the
first time — my earliest recollection is of moving to that house from somewhere
unknown, where my cousin was in a baby carriage, so I couldn’t have been more than
five. Therefore it was the first time, and we were moving, so I remember it. The road,
the sidewalk — there was nothing. It was mud, it was dirt.
Weiner:
Was this near the beach?
Feynman:
About two miles from the beach. We used to go to the beach very often.
Weiner:
What was your father’s occupation?
Feynman:
My father had different jobs and different occupations. The earliest — he apparently
wasn’t too successful, I suppose. I don’t know. I mean in the beginning. The ones I
remember are, for a while he sold “Whiz,” which was some kind of stuff for
automobiles, accessories. We had the garage full of Whiz of different kinds — like
Simonize. Then he was in the cleaning business. He had a cleaning chain called Sanis
Cleaners, New York, which he had with a man whose name was Brockman. (I’m
beginning to remember that.) But the two of them had been partners earlier in a real
estate business that didn’t work out, until a third man, Paul, I think his name was, was
brought in who was clever enough to first oust my father and then his partner. So he got
put out of his tree. And then he went into the uniform business.
Weiner:
On the cleaning business, you mean this was dry cleaning stores?
Feynman:
Dry cleaning stores, yes. He told me, but I don’t remember that he was the first dollar
cleaners. But I don’t know.5
Weiner:
This would put it, by the way, in the twenties some time.
Feynman:
Probably. I can’t swear by the dates. I’m rather confused, after that he worked for a
uniform company, as a sales manager of a uniform outfit called Wender and Goldstein,
which was a big uniform company. And there I would say he was successful, because he
was in the uniform business from then on. I remember most of the time his being in that
business. But now that you ask me, I remember all these other businesses.
Weiner:
What was his educational background, do you recall?
Feynman:
I don’t know it too well. I understand that he went to high school all right. He lived in
Patchogue. He apparently had been taught by his father and also by some special tutors
from time to time that his father got for him. He presumably went through regular high
school. He went to a kind of medical school, the Homeopathic Institute or something.
It’s a strange kind of medicine. But as far as I know the story, which I don’t know very
well, he didn’t have much money so he lived in a house where people were very poor,
and he got involved trying to help them, and upset. So for one reason or another he
stopped his medical school education.
Weiner:
I see. Where was he born, do you recall?
Feynman:
Probably in Patchogue. No — he was born in Minsk. At five he came over to the United
States with his father and mother. Then he lived in a town, Patchogue, in Long Island.
It’s out on Long Island.
Weiner:
I know where that is, it’s near Brookhaven.
Feynman:6
Yes.
Weiner:
And your mother?
Feynman:
My mother comes from a family which was originally German, but which have been here
— her parents came at a young age. Her father was a very successful business in that
business. In fact, he was called the “Father of the trimmed hat business.”
Weiner:
What was her maiden name?
Feynman:
Phillips. Her father’s name Henry Phillips, and her name was Lucille.
Weiner:
And what was your father’s first name?
Feynman:
Melville.
Weiner:
So she was born in this country, and she lived…?
Feynman:
Yes. She had a fine education. She was a relatively successful man’s daughter. She went
to the Ethical Culture School, which apparently had considerable influence on her.
