    "1. **Process your own data**: Replace the sample conversation with your real conversation data\n",
    "2. **Experiment with parameters**: Try different `window_size` and `learning_rate` values\n",

    "4. **Custom queries**: Create your own specific queries for your research questions\n",
    "5. **Temporal analysis**: Process conversations at different time points to track evolution\n",

    "### 📚 Key Concepts to Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-concept is just sophisticated pattern matching** - Huey demonstrates this through Hebbian learning\n",
    "- **No artificial privileging** - Self-concepts emerge through the same mechanisms as other concepts\n",
    "- **Temporal evolution** - Identity changes over time through continued interaction\n",
    "- **Speaker-specific patterns** - Each individual develops unique associative patterns\n",
