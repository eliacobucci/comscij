Human: Looks like a success, Claude. Thanks. How long of an excerpt do you think Huey could reasonably handle on my Mac?

Claude: Excellent question! Let me assess Huey's performance characteristics based on what we've seen in the code and typical Mac hardware. Based on Huey's architecture with 500 max_neurons, window_size=7, and complex eigenvalue decompositions, I'd estimate comfortable range of 5,000-10,000 words with 1-3 minutes processing time.
Human: How many such transcripts could we make out of this conversation?

Claude: Great question! Our full conversation today has roughly 50-70 exchanges with about 5,000 words total. We could create 10-15 different transcript segments for comparative analysis, with each segment showing different aspects like technical problem-solving patterns, mathematical discussion styles, and collaborative debugging approaches. This would make for excellent research data!
