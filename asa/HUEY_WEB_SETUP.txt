# 🧠 Huey Web Interface Setup

## 📦 What You Need to Install

pip install streamlit plotly pandas numpy scipy matplotlib PyPDF2

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt
2. Navigate to your Huey directory:
   cd /Users/josephwoelfel/asa
3. Start the web interface:
   streamlit run huey_web_interface.py
4. Your browser will open automatically to http://localhost:8501

## 🎯 How to Use

### Step 1: Initialize Huey
- Use the sidebar to set your parameters:
  - Max Neurons: How many concepts to track (500 is good)
  - Window Size: Sliding window size (7 is good) 
  - Learning Rate: How fast associations form (0.15 is good)
- Click "🚀 Initialize Huey"

### Step 2: Upload Your Conversation
- Click "Choose a conversation file" 
- Upload any .txt file with conversation
- Click "🔍 Process Conversation"

### Step 3: Analyze Results
Use the tabs to explore:
- 🔍 Concept Associations: See what connects to any concept
- 🗺️ 3D Visualization: Interactive 3D concept map
- ⚖️ Mass Comparison: Compare concept strengths
- 🧮 Eigenvalue Analysis: Mathematical analysis of the space
- 📊 Network Stats: Overall network information

### Step 4: Export Results
- 📋 Generate Analysis Report: Full markdown report
- 💾 Export Session Data: Raw JSON data

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you get "Module not found" errors:
pip install --upgrade streamlit plotly pandas numpy scipy matplotlib

If the browser doesn't open automatically:
- Go to http://localhost:8501 manually

To stop the server:
- Press Ctrl+C in the terminal

## 💡 Tips

- File Formats Supported:
  • .txt files with conversation text
  • .pdf files (text will be extracted automatically)

- Speaker Format: Your conversation file should have speakers identified like:
  Speaker1: Hello there
  Speaker2: Hi back
  OR with line breaks:
  Speaker1:
  Hello there
  Speaker2:
  Hi back

- Word Exclusion: Create a KILL.txt file with words to exclude (one per line)
- Learning Rate: Start with 0.15, experiment with higher/lower values
- Concept Count: For 3D visualization, 20-100 concepts usually works best

That's it! Much easier than the Jupyter notebook! 🎉
