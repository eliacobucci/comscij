I was born in Far Rockaway, a suburb of New York, in 1918. I don't know what's the matter with people: they don't learn by understanding; they learn by some other way - by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile! I would teach the students about the wave equation for a vibrating string. You pluck the string, and it vibrates.
