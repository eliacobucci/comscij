## ⚠️ **Critical Information**

### **Confidentiality**
- **Internal Galileo Company use only**
- **No external sharing** of software or results
- **Anonymize all test data** before processing
- **Delete sensitive results** when testing complete

### **Alpha Software Warnings**
- This is **experimental software** - expect bugs
- **Not for production use** - testing only
- **Save work frequently** - system may crash
- Results need validation through proper testing protocols

### **Scientific Limitations**
- 3D visualizations show only ~15-30% of actual structure
- **Eye candy only** - real analysis is high-dimensional
- Function word contamination may occur
- Stability not yet fully validated

---

## 🎯 **Testing Objectives**

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Stability validation** - consistent results across runs
2. **Reproducibility testing** - same inputs yield same outputs
3. **Performance assessment** - acceptable speed and resource usage
4. **Usability evaluation** - interface clarity and workflow

### **ChatGPT-5 Recommended Tests**
- **Bootstrapping tests** for result stability
- **Cross-session validation** for reproducibility
- **Function word contamination** assessment
- **Theoretical coherence** evaluation

### **Success Criteria**
- Results stable within 10% across multiple runs
- No critical bugs in 2-week testing period
- Theoretical coherence confirmed by domain experts
- Performance acceptable for research applications

---

## 📊 **Expected Performance**

### **Processing Times**
- Small conversations (1-2 pages): 10-30 seconds
- Medium conversations (5-10 pages): 1-3 minutes
- Large conversations (20+ pages): 3-10 minutes

### **System Resources**
- Base memory usage: ~200MB
- Peak memory: 500MB - 2GB (depending on text size)
- CPU usage: High during processing, idle otherwise
- Network: None (all processing local)

---

## 📞 **Support Structure**

### **Installation Issues**
1. Check `troubleshooting/common_issues.md`
2. Verify system meets requirements
3. Contact development team if needed

## 🎓 **Background Information**

### **What is Huey?**
Huey is a Hebbian Self-Concept Analysis Platform that processes conversational text to reveal cognitive structures in high-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian space.

### **Key Innovations**
- **High-dimensional preservation** (250+ dimensions vs typical 2-3D)
- **Pseudo-Riemannian geometry** for complex cognitive relationships
- **Hebbian learning principles** for realistic neural modeling
- **Self-concept identification** through conversation analysis

### **Theoretical Foundation**
- Based on Galileo Theory and multidimensional scaling
- Incorporates Mead's symbolic interactionism
- Validated against established cognitive science principles
- Peer-reviewed by ChatGPT-5 for scientific rigor
