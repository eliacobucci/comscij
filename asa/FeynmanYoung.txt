Feynman:
You start by interrupting me with a question.
Weiner:
That’s right. It saves interruption later. Let’s talk about the earliest recollections you have
of your family, your neighborhood and your home.
Feynman:
Nothing scientific, just a simple —? I don’t know what to say. That’s a hard one. I have
lots of recollections, little bits and pieces.
Weiner:
Let me ask where you lived in Far Rockaway, was this —?
Feynman:
I was born somewhere in New York, but I don’t remember anything except Far
Rockaway, and then we went for some time, I remember, to a house in a place called
Baldwin, on Long Island, where I think we lived a year or a half a year or a summer. And
then, sometime after Far Rockaway, we went to live in Cedarhurst, but then by that time
I was nine or eleven. Then we came back to Far Rockaway again. That gives an outline
of where things were.
Weiner:
When you have recollections of Far Rockaway, what sort of a neighborhood was it?
Feynman:4
There were these two periods, the first and the second. The first time I can’t remember
very well at all. I remember moving to the house. We walked along. It was a big house.
We lived there with my cousins, a cousin family, I mean — my mother’s sisters. The two
families lived together in a big, rather large house, with a big garden. We had a couple, a
man and a woman, who took care of it. I can’t remember which period exactly. But the
first time — my earliest recollection is of moving to that house from somewhere
unknown, where my cousin was in a baby carriage, so I couldn’t have been more than
five. Therefore it was the first time, and we were moving, so I remember it. The road,
the sidewalk — there was nothing. It was mud, it was dirt.
Weiner:
Was this near the beach?
Feynman:
About two miles from the beach. We used to go to the beach very often.
Weiner:
What was your father’s occupation?
Feynman:
My father had different jobs and different occupations. The earliest — he apparently
wasn’t too successful, I suppose. I don’t know. I mean in the beginning. The ones I
remember are, for a while he sold “Whiz,” which was some kind of stuff for
automobiles, accessories. We had the garage full of Whiz of different kinds — like
Simonize. Then he was in the cleaning business. He had a cleaning chain called Sanis
Cleaners, New York, which he had with a man whose name was Brockman. (I’m
beginning to remember that.) But the two of them had been partners earlier in a real
estate business that didn’t work out, until a third man, Paul, I think his name was, was
brought in who was clever enough to first oust my father and then his partner. So he got
put out of his tree. And then he went into the uniform business.
Weiner:
On the cleaning business, you mean this was dry cleaning stores?
Feynman:
Dry cleaning stores, yes. He told me, but I don’t remember that he was the first dollar
cleaners. But I don’t know.5
Weiner:
This would put it, by the way, in the twenties some time.
Feynman:
Probably. I can’t swear by the dates. I’m rather confused, after that he worked for a
uniform company, as a sales manager of a uniform outfit called Wender and Goldstein,
which was a big uniform company. And there I would say he was successful, because he
was in the uniform business from then on. I remember most of the time his being in that
business. But now that you ask me, I remember all these other businesses.
Weiner:
What was his educational background, do you recall?
Feynman:
I don’t know it too well. I understand that he went to high school all right. He lived in
Patchogue. He apparently had been taught by his father and also by some special tutors
from time to time that his father got for him. He presumably went through regular high
school. He went to a kind of medical school, the Homeopathic Institute or something.
It’s a strange kind of medicine. But as far as I know the story, which I don’t know very
well, he didn’t have much money so he lived in a house where people were very poor,
and he got involved trying to help them, and upset. So for one reason or another he
stopped his medical school education.
Weiner:
I see. Where was he born, do you recall?
Feynman:
Probably in Patchogue. No — he was born in Minsk. At five he came over to the United
States with his father and mother. Then he lived in a town, Patchogue, in Long Island.
It’s out on Long Island.
Weiner:
I know where that is, it’s near Brookhaven.
Feynman:6
Yes.
Weiner:
And your mother?
Feynman:
My mother comes from a family which was originally German, but which have been here
— her parents came at a young age. Her father was a very successful business in that
business. In fact, he was called the “Father of the trimmed hat business.”
Weiner:
What was her maiden name?
Feynman:
Phillips. Her father’s name Henry Phillips, and her name was Lucille.
Weiner:
And what was your father’s first name?
Feynman:
Melville.
Weiner:
So she was born in this country, and she lived…?
Feynman:
Yes. She had a fine education. She was a relatively successful man’s daughter. She went
to the Ethical Culture School, which apparently had considerable influence on her.
Weiner:
In New York? Manhattan?
Feynman:7
Yes. That’s right.
Weiner:
And did she go to college?
Feynman:
No. That’s as far as she went. No, she didn’t go to college.
Weiner:
So if I interpreted correctly what you said about your father, he didn’t?
Feynman:
I don’t think he ever successfully went to college. However, he did teach himself a great
deal. He read a lot and he studied a lot, because, as I know now, he understood a great
deal about science, by teaching himself or by learning from his father or from other
people. He was rational. He liked the rational mind, and liked those things which could
be understood by thinking.
Weiner:
When you say he was interested in science, or knew about it, in what way was this
expressed?
Feynman:
As far as I’m concerned? Well, these two stories are rumors, as far as I’m concerned, but
the story is that before I was born he told my mother: “If it’s a boy, he’ll be a scientist.”
But you’ll have to talk to my mother to verify this. I don’t know if I got the story right.
Weiner:
Is your mother alive?
Feynman:
Yes. She lives in Pasadena. No, my father’s dead.
Weiner:8
When did he die?
Feynman:
1948, probably — l948, probably — 1948, 1947, 1949, something like that.
Weiner:
After that your mother moved to Pasadena?
Feynman:
Quite a bit after that. She lived in New York a while. She’s only been here about seven,
eight years. Anyway, he said that to my mother, before I was born. And he played a lot
with me. I mean, we had a very good relationship. We fooled around a lot. He’d tell me
about things all the time. And the other rumor, which I can’t exactly remember, is that
when I was very small, he went to a company that made bathroom tiles and got a lot of
old extra tiles, you know, and then he would stand them up on my high chair, on end, in
a long row — as you do with dominos. Then when we’d get all ready, I would be
allowed to push it at the end, and the whole pile would go over. We’d play this game.
But you’d have to verify it with my mother, of course, because I don’t remember exactly.
But he would then take a game. He’d say, “Now we put a white one, now a blue one,
now a white one, now a blue one.” Sometimes I’d want to put two blue ones together
and he’d say, “No, no, must be a white one now.” My mothered tell me that she would
say, “Now let the boy put a blue one.” He’d say, “No, we have to get him to understand
patterns.” This was the only thing I could do at this age, to think about patterns and
recognize those things as being interesting. After a short time with this game, I could do
extremely elaborate patterns. I mean, once I paid attention — two blues, a white, a
brown, two whites, to two blues, a white — and so on. So he started in as early as he
could with what he said was a kind of mathematics, sort of the shadow of mathematics.
He was always playing games and telling me things, which he realized were scientific,
bearing relation to science.
Weiner:
This pattern recognition training, you say, was in your high chair, so this was very young?
Feynman:
Very young, so it’s not in my memory. It’s been told to me. But then there was
something else that I do remember, because when I got into kindergarten, which is of
course much later, six years old, they had a thing in those days which was weaving, so
called. They had a kind of colored paper, square paper, with about quarter inch slots
made parallel, a quarter inch wide, and then quarter inch strips of paper. See, one was the9
woof, and the other was — whatever it is, warp. You’re supposed to weave it and made
designs. You see? That was regular and interesting. Apparently that’s extremely difficult
for a child, and I was especially commented on. The teacher was very excited and
surprised. I had no difficulty. I made elaborate patterns correctly by doing this thing,
without any difficulty, whereas it was so difficult for most other children that they don’t
do that in kindergarten any more. So apparently I had learned something already, back
then.
Weiner:
Did you do any drawing in this period? Do you remember any?
Feynman:
No, I was no good at drawing, ever. I don’t think I was. My father was fairly good at it,
and he would try to show me some things with drawing, much later. I don’t know the
dates, but I remember him explaining to me how to make letters by dark on the one side
— the light comes from one side. You know, like sign letters, or they looked like the
gold letters that they used to glue up against the butcher stores. If you just imagined that
there was a strip of letter there, and just colored it on one side, from the way the light
would have caught it, it gives that effect. And so on. He’d show me tricks in drawing, but
I wasn’t ever very adept at drawing. I didn’t pick that up.
Weiner:
Let me ask at this point whether there were any brothers or sisters in the family?
Feynman:
There was a sister. There was a brother that came after approximately three years. Or
maybe I was five, four, six, three, I don’t remember. But that brother died, after a
relatively short time, like a month or so. I can still remember that, so I can’t have been
too young, because I can remember especially that the brother had a finger bleeding all
the time. That’s what happened — it was some kind of disease that didn’t heal. And also,
asking the nurse how they knew whether it was a boy or a girl, and being taught: it’s by
the shape of the ear — and thinking that that’s rather strange. There’s so much
difference in the world between men and women that they should bother to make any
difference, a boy from a girl, with just the shape of the ear! It didn’t sound like a sensible
thing. Now, I remember that I had another, a sister, when I was nine years old, so it’s
possible that I’m remembering my question at the age of nine or ten, and not at the age
of the other child, because it sounds incredible to me now that I would have had such a
deep thought about society at the earlier age. I don’t know. I can’t tell you what age I
was, but I remember that, because it was an interesting answer. I couldn’t understand it10

circulars from printer so and so. Do you need a boy to deliver them?” He said, “That’s a
great idea.” I would never have thought of that. He had a businessman’s mind, Mr.
Walker. So that’s what we did, and the printer was so impressed with our ingenuity that
he said he needed a boy to take care of the place, and so he hired the two of us,
alternately, to do this, you see. He was impressed by the cleverness of this, Bernie’s idea.
Weiner:
Was this for spending money? I mean, this wasn’t —
Feynman:
Yes, I think so. There was also the attitude that you should do something, work — you
know, the idea that to hang around and do nothing was somehow… There was a feeling
of some sort of responsibility to earn money. I can’t explain it.
Weiner:
Well, it was also the Depression period. This would have emphasized it.
Feynman:
Yes. And also, to do some work like that, that’s good. I don’t know why, but that was
the feeling — we should do it. I’m sure that if I didn’t, I would have got the spending
money, because it wasn’t a lot of money, really. But the idea that you should get a job
was somehow right. I don’t know (women’s tales) yeah…
Weiner:
When you were in high school, were you thinking about college? When did you start
thinking about what the next step was going to be in your education?
Feynman:
I don’t know when I started to think about that. I must have thought about it. I knew
that I was going to go to college. In this particular high school there were two kinds of
courses, one called the commercial course, and one called, I don’t know, the academic
course or something — I don’t remember — but anyway, one was supposed to be for
college and the other wasn’t. There never was any question. I was not in the commercial
course. It was my parents who knew I would go to college, and who in fact were saving,
in spite of the Depression, as best they could, to make sure that I could to go any college
I wanted, when the time came. So they were the ones.72
Weiner:
Were you — (crosstalk)
Feynman:
The finances, no — although they had their problems, but the problems were not
communicated to me. I was always guaranteed, you know, that — But I did have a
feeling of responsibility to make whatever effort I could to help. But there was no fear
that it wouldn’t go through. So I never really was deeply concerned. I never had a
decision, (I can’t remember any) when I would go to college or something.
Weiner:
But then at one point you had to make a decision, because you had to apply.
Feynman:
Of course, because I had to apply. I then applied to the colleges. One I applied to was
CCNY, I think, because of the financial thing, in case we couldn’t make it. I applied to
Columbia. I applied to MIT. What else I applied to, I don’t remember.
Weiner:
Excuse me a minute. Did you have, at that time, the state Regents’ examination?
Feynman:
Yes, we did, on all the courses.
Weiner:
Do you remember how you did?
Feynman:
Yes, I have all the records, if you want.
Weiner:
How did you do? We’ll look at the records too.
Feynman:73
In mathematics and science it was the absolute top, 99 percent, 100 percent sometimes,
or 90, very close. In the other subjects, in the neighborhood of 80 something. I did
better in the Regents’ than I did in the courses themselves. You know, I was always able,
if I had pressure enough, to work very hard and temporarily absorb enough information,
say in German, to make a passing grade, and then forget the whole damn thing.
Weiner:
Cramming?
Feynman:
Cramming, yeah.
Weiner:
Then, with decent Regents’ scores and these applications —
Feynman:
Fairly decent. Only fair. But good in the math and science.
Weiner:
You applied to these different institutions. At that time, did you know what curriculum
you would choose, if you were accepted?
Feynman:
I thought I would go into mathematics, I think. I did, in fact, when I got to MIT, so I
don’t know exactly what I thought on that, but that’s what I did.
Weiner:
Were you accepted at the other schools too?
Feynman:
I don’t remember about CCNY. I was not accepted at Columbia. They said “No” They
have an examination also, which I took, and lost fifteen bucks. You have to pay, apply,
and take the exam. I remember the fifteen bucks. But I flunked -– somehow — I didn’t
get in. At MIT they had a few scholarships, which I applied for and didn’t get. I just got
in the regular way. I think maybe I did get a small scholarship; I’m not sure, but not the74
big scholarship that I had hoped for.
Weiner:
Were there any examinations for this?
Feynman:
No, there weren’t examinations.
Weiner:
Based on existing records.
Feynman:
Yes.
Weiner:
How about College Entrance Examination, Boards?
Feynman:
There was no such thing, as far as I remember. There was only this exam at Columbia.
Weiner:
I think these existed perhaps earlier, but they weren’t universal.
Feynman:
Maybe. Yeah. One thing, just to put into the record, which I didn’t like, at the time,
about MIT, was that they required a recommendation from a former student of MIT. I
didn’t know any former student at MIT. So I went to this man’s office. The man talked
to me for ten minutes, and then wrote, “This guy’s a good man.” I think that’s all evil,
that’s all wrong, because it’s dishonest. I was a very honest sort of scientific — if I want
anything — it’s true, you know. And that the school would request such a thing, and I
had to go through this falseness — it bothered me. I remember it. I just put that in. That
one thing I didn’t like about applying to that school.
Weiner:75
Why MIT?
Feynman:
It was supposed to be one of the best schools in science and technology.
Weiner:
How did you learn that, that it was supposed to be?
Feynman:
I don’t know. My father probably knew that. My father probably thought that — you
see, because I think my father and mother discussed it. MIT was more expensive than
the local schools, I think. This I’m imagining, because I remember, later, say, how the
two of them sat down and they tried to figure out how with the budget they could send
me to the best school. They were great — you know? I mean, they were right behind me.
Weiner:
Did you have any idea who was at MIT?
Feynman:
People? Oh, no. Just that it was a good school. I didn’t know in terms of people.
Weiner:
So you graduated from high school in —
Feynman:
— 1935. Right.
Weiner:
And what did you do that summer? Was that any different from any other summer?
Feynman:
That’s the summer I got the job in — was it? No. What the heck did I do that summer?
No. I don’t remember.76
Weiner:
What about other summers in high school?
Feynman:
I usually tried to work. I worked in my aunt’s hotel, a few summers. One summer I was
ill. Oh, that was after, when I was at MIT. I was ill from the work at MIT, apparently,
over — something, and the doctor insisted that I relax that summer, so I stayed in bed
and drank malted milks, and would just go to the beach — I had a great summer. But I
was ill. I had gotten ill.
Weiner:
After your freshman year?
Feynman:
Yes, the freshman year. But that takes us ahead. You asked about social matters, and
there are a lot of social matters to be discussed yet. Girls. We really didn’t get to it.
Weiner:
In high school.
Feynman:
Yes. I don’t know if you want to get into it now, or continue in this direction? I thought
I’d remind you, before we get into the first year of college, that you left something out.
Weiner:
Yes, let’s go back then.
Feynman:
All right. Since I had been a sissy and so on, I was a little bit worried about this
relationship with girls. There were some other social things that were very good. There
was a Jewish Center in town that got the idea to make a junior something — I don’t
know what you call it, a “junior league” or something — which was built to make the
young kids of the high school happy. It was an organization that was supposed to be run
by them. It had its own president and so on, but they would use the buildings that were
associated with the Jewish Temple. And it was really, now that I think of it, quite a
wonderful effort. They had teachers to come to help, and we were divided into units, like77
there was a dramatic unit, an art unit, a writer’s unit where the people who liked to write,
like my friend who liked to write, would get together, and they would tell the story that
they would write, and then the next week some other guy would write a story and tell it,
you know. They’d discuss it. And in the art unit — which I joined, for a reason which I
will explain in a minute — we started by making plaster casts of heads, of faces. You
know, you lie on the floor and put the plaster on and have straws out of the nose and all
this kind of thing. And then we’d try to make artistic things, for which I had no talent
whatsoever. The reason I joined the art unit was that I had met a very beautiful and
wonderful girl who was very, very interested in art, and she was joining the art unit. So, I
didn’t know her too well — I mean, as a matter of fact, I understood that she was the
girl-friend of some other guy, and it was absolutely hopeless, because they were
completely… But I joined anyway, you know, so I could be there, because I was
dreaming of her. I don’t remember the order of events, but some way I met her at a
party. I think the first time I met her was at a party at which somebody was teaching us
how to neck and showing us how we should kiss a girl — the lips should be at right
angles, and this kind of stuff. And then we sat and practiced with some girl.
Weiner:
He demonstrated before the group?
Feynman:
Yes, with some girl. He was a little older than the others. Then we would sit and we’d try
to neck. I had a girl I was practicing with. Then, just at this moment, there was a little
excitement -– “Arlene is coming!” — and everybody gets excited. It was the older group
I was with, you see. Everybody jumps up to great her. And I figure, nobody is that
important — you know, this is not the way to behave — so I just kept on…
Weiner:
— practicing?
Feynman:
Practicing. She remembered it later, that she came in, and there was one person in the
party she didn’t like because he was necking in the corner. Nobody else was doing such a
terrible thing. Anyway, we started out on the wrong foot. But at another party, where she
was — I had seen her, and then I was really impressed with this Arlene, I understood
why everybody had jumped up. I was at another party where she was. For a reason that I
don’t know, she sat on the arm of my chair. So there was hope. I was excited as the
devil. She was with this older group, you know. She was in this junior center, so that’s
why I joined the art group. There was no science group, there was nothing like that in
this junior center, but it was social. There were dances. It was a good thing to join, in78
spite of the fact — And so therefore I got to know her, and then I got to know her boy-
friend, who, it turned out, she broke up with, or it turned out she wasn’t with him, and
gradually I got to know her better. I took her to the dance. I told you that there was a
lady with a dancing school that my mother knew, so I took her to that dance, and I
introduced her to my friends, and the playwright man, by the name of Harold Gast,
came up to me to tell me very carefully that “that’s my girl” and he’s “not interested,”
etc. I’ve since learned that that’s a dead signal to watch out, when they protest too much.
Anyway, he was then my competitor, after that, after his assertion that she was my girl
and he would not interfere — a thing which I had not even asked for. But I learned. So
he was a kind of competitor. She would go with him, or with me, all the time. When I
went to MIT, we wrote letters back and forth. But the day when I really — I don’t know
what really convinced her, but one day that I realized that I was getting ahead of Mr.
Gast was the day we graduated from high school. She was invited to our graduation. We
were both graduating together. He had written a play. She sat between our parents —
she was a very sensible girl. It happened that I won a lot of medals, for best in physics,
best in chemistry, and best in mathematics. He wrote the play, but I was getting called to
the platform every few minutes, you know -– “Now the prize for physics” –- “Now the
prize for chemistry” — “for mathematics” — and so on. It was get up and get down, get
up and get down, and because of a fluke — a fluke — when it came to English, because
of the fluke that they had decided this thing on the Regents’ grade and nothing else,
which was unfair, because it could be am accident from cramming or an accident of the
system — I had been relatively poor in English and these fellows had been very good.
And my two friends, the playwright and the writer for the newspaper, neither of them
got honors in English because they did badly on the last Regents — and I did! So this
was a freakish accident. I know why I did, because for one time in my life I finally broke
down in the English. Everybody, I listen to them talk; they’re a kind of baloney. They
don’t talk direct, in English class, and I’m always trying to talk straight. In the
examination, in the Regents’ examination, they had things like, “Take a book and make a
book review,” and I would take the simplest freshman book, TREASURE ISLAND,
while my friends would try something like Sinclair Lewis’ book about the stockyards or
something. Mine, though dull, was all right, so the dull teachers said OK — but she had
objections to his interpretations of the social relations. You know, she was much more
interested. But the real place where I faked it was, they gave us a list of compositions
that we could write on different subjects, and for a change they had a few scientific
subjects in there, one of which was “The Importance of Science in Aviation.” To me this
seemed incredible, that the person who had made up the title was an ass, because it was
so obvious. I mean, it’s such a dumb kind of a subject. But I figured for once I’m going
to do what I see my friends do. So I wrote an article, in which I talked about the
importance of science in the analysis of vortices, eddies, turbulence, and swirling
motions of the air — all the same thing, you see. So I made these big words and I
repeated myself, I did all that baloney and I got a very good — I think that’s why I got a
good grade in the English quiz. I did it for the first time consciously, because I thought it
was so silly, nobody knows anything, so it’s easy to write about these things. Anyhow,
this seemed to have impressed my girl, but the thing that impressed her most was the79
following: My parents, my mother — I don’t know about whether my father was there, I
can’t remember — and Mrs. Gast went together down the hallway afterwards to talk to
the teachers, after graduation, and they met Mr. Ogsberry in the hall, and he (my mother
said) — They said, “I’m Mrs. Gast and this is Mrs. Feynman.” He said, “Oh, Mrs.
Feynman!” Just like that, you see. And then he makes her think, to try to impress her,
what I had –- “Your son has something the state should support, and it shouldn’t be
necessary…” Big deal. He made a great speech. He was very impressed by his students.
And Mrs. Gast kept saying, “What about my boy Harold?” “Oh, Harold’s all right, never
mind Harold — now listen, Mrs. Feynman —” What he was worried about was that the
parent might not understand, and might say to the child he must get a job or something.
See, he was worried, but he didn’t have to worry, because my parents were aware of this.
My friend Stapler’s parents were not — his mother; his father was dead. She was not that
kind. He had to go out to get money, because she needed money, and that was the end
of him, really. So I was lucky. But anyway, this girl-friend, Arlene, was standing there,
listening to all this, you see. And after that I had a little easier job against Harold Gast.
Or at least I imagined that that was the reason. Anyway, I fell gradually in love with this
girl, and it took me six years before we got engaged. I met her at thirteen, when I was
thirteen. I was thirteen and a half, she was thirteen, something like that, and we got
engaged six years later, and we were married another seven years later. I knew her for
thirteen years before we got married. It was quite an unusually long situation. We were
very much in love by that time. A most marvelous woman. We had a terrific relationship.
Weiner:
You were married in 1940 — something?
Feynman:
1941 or 1942, yeah. Details we’ll put in when the time comes, if you want. Then, when I
was at MIT — I’ve cut the end of the high school. Yeah, that was the best girl, the most
important girl. There were a few dates here and there with other girls, but this was the
most important one.
Weiner:
You won these awards. Were they honors or specific awards?
Feynman:
Well, like medals, you know. I think it was maybe the Exchange Club of Far Rockaway
would give a chemistry medal, by giving the money for the medal. The Bausch and
Lomb Optical Co. gave the medal for science, I think, and they probably had a policy of
giving the medals to the high schools for science, to finance it. So I remember, it was
Bausch and Lomb that gave that, because my father kept saying to me, “Listen, you’ve80
