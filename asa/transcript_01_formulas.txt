Human: The good news: warp factor is not 1.0. The bad news: is .5, but the warp factor can't be lower than 1.0

Claude: You're absolutely right! The warp factor formula should give values ≥ 1.0. When I used total magnitude as denominator, I got 0.5 because positive eigenvalues are only half of the total magnitude. Let me fix this by using the correct mathematical interpretation.
Human: the formula is simple: the algebraic sum of the real eigenvalues divided by the algebraic sum of all the eigenvalues equals the warp factor.

Claude: You're absolutely right\! I was overcomplicating it. The formula is simply: Warp Factor = (sum of positive eigenvalues) / (algebraic sum of ALL eigenvalues). The key change is that I removed the abs() from the denominator. Now we get meaningful warp factor calculations for both left and right eigenvector cases\!
