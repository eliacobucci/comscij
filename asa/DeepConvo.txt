[Alex]: Hey, Bailey! Long time no see. How’s life treating you?
[Bailey]: Alex! Just grabbing coffee before work. Life’s busy but good. You?
[Alex]: Same here. Surviving the corporate grind. Did you finish that coding bootcamp?
[Bailey]: Graduated last week! Now job hunting. Nerves are real.
[Alex]: Congrats! You’ll crush it. Still painting for stress relief?
[Bailey]: Every weekend. My apartment’s covered in canvases. How’s your photography going?
[Alex]: Sold two prints last month! Feels surreal. Oh, tried that new Thai place?
[Bailey]: Not yet. Worth it?
[Alex]: Spicy but amazing. We should go—my treat for your graduation.
[Bailey]: Deal! How’s your dog, Luna? Still stealing socks?
[Alex]: Worse—she hid my keys yesterday. You still volunteering at the shelter?
[Bailey]: Every Saturday. Adopted out three kittens this week!
[Alex]: Hero! Speaking of heroes… finally watched Starfall like you begged.
[Bailey]: AND? Don’t leave me hanging!
[Alex]: Captain Vex’s twist? Mind. Blown.
[Bailey]: TOLD YOU! Who’s your favorite side character?
[Alex]: Zara. Her backstory episode wrecked me.
[Bailey]: Same! Though I’m salty about the Season 3 cliffhanger…
[Alex]: Right? That spaceship explosion felt cheap.
[Bailey]: Total cop-out. Writers better fix it.
[Alex]: Agreed. Changing topic—you seeing Maya’s wedding next month?
[Bailey]: Wouldn’t miss it. Still need a plus-one though…
[Alex]: Same boat. Let’s be awkward singles together.
[Bailey]: Perfect. Dance floor meltdowns incoming.
[Alex]: Naturally. Oh! Almost forgot—my sister’s bakery needs a website. Interested?
[Bailey]: Seriously? That’d be my first freelance gig!
[Alex]: I’ll text you her contact. Pay’s decent!
[Bailey]: You’re a lifesaver. Coffee’s on me next time.
[Alex]: Better believe it. Gotta run—meeting in 20.
[Bailey]: Go! Text me Thai place details later?
[Alex]: Absolutely. Congrats again, future tech star!
[Bailey]: Thanks, future Ansel Adams!
[Alex]: (Texts later) Spice Garden, 7 PM Friday? They do vegan options.
[Bailey]: Perfect! I’ll bring my tolerance for heat… and my critique of Starfall’s costume design.
[Alex]: Oh, this I gotta hear. Prepare for counter-arguments about Zara’s armor.
[Bailey]: Bring it. Also—random Q: best hiking trail nearby? Need nature time.
[Alex]: Eagle Ridge! 4-mile loop with a waterfall. Luna’s obsessed.
[Bailey]: Sold. Sunday? I’ll pack sandwiches.
[Alex]: You’re my favorite human. 9 AM?
[Bailey]: Deal. Swear you won’t make me pose for photos every 5 mins?
[Alex]: Zero promises. My camera misses your grumpy morning face.
[Bailey]: Rude. Remember who’s bringing the coffee thermos.
[Alex]: ...I retract all sass. Hazelnut creamer?
[Bailey]: Obviously. How’s Luna’s key-hiding rehab going?
[Alex]: Progress! Now she just licks them aggressively.
[Bailey]: [Laughs] Classic. Found a lead on a junior dev job, btw.
[Alex]: YES! Details?
[Bailey]: Startup downtown. Eco-focused apps. Interview next week.
[Alex]: Nailed it. Wear the galaxy-print tie. Looks smart.
[Bailey]: Superstition? Thought you hated that tie.
[Alex]: I hate how GOOD it looks on you. Secret weapon.
[Bailey]: Aw. Thanks, man.
[Alex]: Always. Oh! Maya’s wedding colors are navy and gold.
[Bailey]: Noted. I own exactly one navy shirt. Crisis averted.
[Alex]: Same. We’ll match. Tragic.
[Bailey]: Coordinated tragedy. Your mom still asking when we’ll “date seriously”?
[Alex]: Ugh, yes. Told her you’re too busy coding world domination.
[Bailey]: Accurate. Tell her I’m married to my paintbrushes.
[Alex]: She’ll ask if they’re registered at Bed Bath & Beyond.
[Bailey]: [Snorts coffee] Stop. How’s your dad’s garden this year?
[Alex]: Tomatoes are winning. Zucchini? Apocalyptic. We’re drowning in it.
[Bailey]: Bring some Friday? I’ll make my infamous chocolate-zucchini bread.
[Alex]: Infamous? Did you poison someone?
[Bailey]: Only metaphorically. Greg from IT said it tasted “earthy.”
[Alex]: Greg thinks ketchup is spicy. I’ll risk it.
[Bailey]: Hiking tomorrow—supposed to rain. Still on?
[Alex]: 100%. Waterproof gear ready. Luna’s got a tiny raincoat.
[Bailey]: Pics or it didn’t happen.
[Alex]: Oh, you’ll suffer through the entire photoshoot.
[Bailey]: Worth it for those sandwiches. Made them extra spicy.
[Alex]: Revenge for the Thai place bet? Low blow.
[Bailey]: Always. Interview prep—help me mock-question?
[Alex]: “Why do you want this job?” GO.
[Bailey]: “Because sustainable tech merges my passion for code with—”
[Alex]: WRONG. “Because I enjoy not being homeless.” Honesty!
[Bailey]: [Groans] You’re the worst practice partner.
[Alex]: But hilarious. Real answer: “Your mission aligns with my values.” Then dazzle them.
[Bailey]: ...That’s actually good. Stealing it.
[Alex]: Trademarked! Royalties in zucchini bread.
(Midway - Wedding & Hooking)
[Bailey]: Wedding shoes acquired. Blister-prevention plan: duct tape.
[Alex]: Genius. My plan: sit as much as possible.
[Bailey]: Coward. We’re dancing to all the ABBA.
[Alex]: If I must. Hiking was epic, btw. Your “spicy” sandwich nearly melted my face.
[Bailey]: Success! And you got great shots of the waterfall.
[Alex]: Posted one. Got 50 likes already.
[Bailey]: Narcissist. Tag me!
[Alex]: Done. Shelter busy this week?
[Bailey]: Adopted out a senior dog! Cried happy tears.
[Alex]: Softie. Luna approves. How’s the bakery site coming?
[Bailey]: Draft done! Sending to your sister tonight.
[Alex]: She’ll freak (in a good way). Payment secured!
[Bailey]: Cha-ching. Thai tonight—how spicy are we going? 1-10.
[Alex]: Let’s live dangerously. 8.
[Bailey]: ...I regret everything.
[Alex]: Starfall news! Spinoff confirmed: Zara’s origin story!
[Bailey]: SHUT UP. Release date?!
[Alex]: Next fall. But get this—new showrunner.
[Bailey]: Risky. Hope they don’t ruin her.
[Alex]: Same. Brunch Saturday to overanalyze the trailer?
[Bailey]: Obviously. I’ll bring my “Zara Deserved Better” mood board.
[Alex]: Never change. Interview tomorrow—nervous?
[Bailey]: Terrified. What if I blank?
[Alex]: Impossible. Remember: galaxy tie = instant genius.
[Bailey]: Magic tie theory. I believe it.
[Alex]: Text me when it’s over. Rooting for you!
[Bailey]: Thanks, man. Seriously.
[Alex]: WELL?! How’d it go?!
[Bailey]: THEY LOVED ME. Second interview Friday!
[Alex]: [Calls] TOLD YOU! Celebrate at Thai tonight!
[Bailey]: Yes! But spice level 6. My stomach needs mercy.
[Alex]: Compromise: 7. Luna demands celebration scritches.
[Bailey]: Deal. Also... Maya’s wedding seating chart is out.
[Alex]: Do we sit with cool people or Aunt Carol?
[Bailey]: Worse. Table 9: all her ex-boyfriends.
[Alex]: [Laughs] We’ll survive. Bring earplugs for their drama.
[Bailey]: Packing extra. Did you finish that sci-fi book I lent you?
[Alex]: YES. Ending wrecked me. Why’d you do that?
[Bailey]: Shared pain is real pain. My turn—recommend me something happy.
[Alex]: Legends & Lattes. Orc opens a coffee shop. Zero angst.
[Bailey]: Sold. Swapping books Saturday?
[Alex]: Yep. Brunch, books, Zara conspiracy theories.
[Bailey]: Thai place tonight—running 10 mins late. Luna hide your keys again?
[Alex]: No, MY fault. Ironed the galaxy tie for you.
[Bailey]: [Laughing] You’re ridiculous. See you soon!
[Alex]: Hurry! I ordered extra spring rolls to sabotage your diet.
[Bailey]: Evil genius. Table by the window?
[Alex]: Yep. With a view of the chili pepper decor... taunting us.
[Bailey]: Bring it. Oh—before I forget... Pineapple on pizza: yes or no?
[Alex]: ABSOLUTELY NOT. Fruit doesn’t belong on pizza!
[Bailey]: Philistine. It’s sweet, tangy perfection!
[Alex]: This friendship may not survive this.
[Bailey]: Too late. We’re stuck surviving Table 9 together.
[Alex]: Fair. See you in 5. Try not to trip!
[Bailey]: No promises. Save me a chili!
[Alex]: Never. They’re MINE.
[Bailey]: [Arrives, panting] Made it! Where’s my tie-admiring photographer?
[Alex]: Here! Menu’s open to the “Dragon’s Breath Curry.” Ready?
[Bailey]: ...I brought antacids. Let’s do this.
[Alex]: That’s the spirit. To surviving spice—and weddings!
[Bailey]: Cheers! And thanks... for everything.
[Alex]: Always, B. Now—defend your pineapple heresy.
[Bailey]: With pleasure. Pass the chili flakes...
