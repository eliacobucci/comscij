Human: so where are we? The warp is still wrong, what's our next move?

Claude: You're right, let's focus. We have symmetric case working correctly but left/right cases still showing suspicious perfect balance. The problem is that perfect balance is mathematically impossible in real data. Let me check what's happening in the latest debug output to see if the eigenvalue sorting fixed anything.
Human: the likelihood of perfect balance is smaller than beating the house at Las Vegas. No way\!

Claude: You're absolutely right\! The probability of perfect balance (sum exactly zero) is astronomically small. This suggests there's something wrong with our eigenvalue calculation or data. Let me check what's actually happening by adding more detailed debugging to see the raw eigenvalues.
