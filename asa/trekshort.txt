                            TEASER                              

	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	racing through space at warp speed.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, Stardate 41209.2.
			We are running at Warp 7 to
			rendezvous with the science vessel
			S. S. Tsiolkovsky...

2    FULL ON WHITE DWARF (OPTICAL)

	with the S.S. Tsiolkovsky in orbit. Then the Enterprise
	appears and moves in to join the research vessel.

					PICARD (V.O.)
				(continuing)
			... which has been routinely
			monitoring the collapse of a red
			supergiant star into a white
			dwarf. What has brought us here
			is a series of strange messages
			indicating something has gone
			wrong aboard the research vessel.

3    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	All regulars on duty -- Data at Ops, Geordi at Conn, Tasha
	and Worf upstage intent on main viewer which shows the
	Enterprise moving in parallel with the research vessel.
	First, a STATIC GARBLE, then a WOMAN'S VOICE over the
	audio channel, low and insinuating. INDISTINCT VOICES,
	LAUGHTER, IN B.G. indicate the SOUNDS OF A NOISY PARTY.

					WOMAN'S COM VOICE
			Well, hello Enterprise.
			Welcome... I hope you have a lot
			of pretty boys on board... because
			I'm willing... and waiting...

	They wait for more, then Picard nods toward Data.


          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/30/87          2.

3    CONTINUED:

					DATA
				(touches com panel)
			S.S. Tsiolkovsky, repeat your
			message.

					WOMAN'S COM VOICE
				(laughter, then)
			In fact... we're going to have a
			real blowout here... Thought that
			would interest you. Waiting!

	She LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY. There is MORE LAUGHTER FROM
	THE OTHERS, some cries of "DO IT! GO AHEAD!" in b.g.
	of the transmission, an EXPLOSIVE SOUND -- and then
	silence. After a beat:

					DATA
			Captain... what we just heard is,
			well...impossible.

					PICARD
			Report.

					DATA
				(quietly)
			I believe that last sound we heard
			was an emergency hatch being
			blown.

	The subspace channel is still open -- all we HEAR is
	the HISS OF EMPTY AIR.

					PICARD
			Are you certain... yes, of course
			you are.

	Riker comes to his feet fast, gets a nod from Picard,
	motions for Data, Geordi and Tasha to follow him to the
	turbolift.

					WORF
			Sensor scan now reveals no life
			signs aboard, Captain.

4    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)

	The away team consists of RIKER, GEORDI, DATA, TASHA,
	and a SECURITY GUARD. Data and Geordi have tricorders;
	Tasha has the large phaser.

					RIKER
			Put us on their bridge, Chief.

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/30/87          3.

4    CONTINUED:

					TRANSPORTER CHIEF
			Life support systems are not
			functioning in that area, sir.

	Riker nods to the TRANSPORTER CHIEF at the console.

					RIKER
			Then put us in the main corridor.
			Energize.

	The Transporter Chief works his console controls deftly.
	As the TRANSPORTER EFFECT AND SOUNDS BEGIN AND BUILD:

5    INT. TSIOLKOVSKY MAIN CORRIDOR - ON AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)

	The TRANSPORTER EFFECT COMES IN, FADES DOWN, leaving
	the away team materialized. The ship is very quiet --
	a low HUM of working equipment, but without the murmur
	of living beings.

					RIKER
			Cover the ship as planned. Move
			out.

	Data and Geordi put tricorders on "record" and all move
	out.

6    INT. SECOND CORRIDOR - ON RIKER AND DATA (OPTICAL)

	This corridor shows signs of phaser char marks on the
	walls. There is litter on the deck -- food, a wine
	bottle, discarded clothes. Data records the scene with
	his tricorder, as:

					DATA
			Indications of what humans would
			call... a "wild party?"

	Riker has moved quickly to a door at the end of the
	corridor. It is shut, but there is a small viewscreen
	set in the wall beside it.

					RIKER
			Their bridge. If this thing
			works, be sure to record ---

	He activates the viewscreen, takes a look, and GROANS.

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87          4.

7    CLOSE SHOT - SMALL VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	Narrow view of a small bridge (SET FRAGMENT), mostly
	consoles, maybe a command chair. And beyond these, the
	emergency hatch set in the bulkhead -- the hatch is
	gone, and the cold glitter of a starfield winks beyond
	it. (SET DRESSING NOTE: There should be no loose
	objects visible, only items that are firmly anchored
	to deck or bulkhead. Anything loose would have been
	swept into space when the air rushed out into the
	vacuum.)

8    WIDER SHOT - RIKER AND DATA

	Riker steps aside, gesturing to Data to record the scene
	on the viewer as:

					RIKER
			You were right. Somebody blew
			the hatch and they were all sucked
			out into space..

					DATA
			Correction, sir, blown out.

					RIKER
			Thank you, Data.

					DATA
			A common mistake, sir...

					RIKER
				(emphasis)
			I know! Thank you, Data.

					TASHA'S COM VOICE
			Commander Riker, it's Lieutenant
			Yar, location Engineering. Ten
			people here, sir, all frozen.
			No vital signs.

					RIKER
				(touches communicator)
			Frozen how?

					TASHA'S COM VOICE
			Looks to me like someone was
			"playing" with the environmental
			controls, sir. Just let all the
			heat bleed away into space.

					RIKER
				(to Data)
			That's ridiculous!

					TASHA'S COM VOICE
			That's what I say, sir.

          STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 6/26/87          5.

9    INT. PERSONNEL QUARTERS - ANGLE ON ENTRY DOOR

	as it opens heavily and causes a slight AIR HISSING.
	Geordi ENTERS from the corridor, reacts to the AIR
	HISSING, hits a wall control on the inside. His
	expression changes to one of dismay as he looks around.
