# Huey: Advanced Semantic Space Mapping and Neural Network Simulation

**Research Project Summary for Academic Reporting**

---

## Project Overview

The Huey project represents a cutting-edge approach to computational semantic analysis, combining temporal learning algorithms with neurobiologically-inspired network architectures. Our research focuses on developing scalable methods for mapping high-dimensional semantic spaces from conversational and textual data.

## Key Technical Innovations

### Temporal Mix Learning
Implementation of frequency-damped temporal learning with inverse frequency weighting, enabling more sophisticated relationship modeling than traditional co-occurrence methods.

### Neural Cascade Simulation
Real-time activation propagation modeling that demonstrates semantic association pathways (e.g., "sunset" → "bay" → "flying" → "saucers").

### Spectral Guardrails
Advanced matrix conditioning techniques including eigenvalue spectrum control, ensuring network stability at scale.

### 3D Visualization Pipeline
Interactive semantic space rendering for exploratory data analysis and intuitive understanding of conceptual relationships.

## Scalability Achievements

Unlike traditional approaches limited by O(n²) renormalization bottlenecks, Huey efficiently processes networks with 100+ concepts and 2000+ connections, making it suitable for real-world conversational datasets and large-scale text corpora.

## Applications

- Discourse analysis
- Conversation mapping
- Semantic network discovery
- Cognitive modeling
- Natural language understanding

The system provides both quantitative metrics and intuitive visualizations for understanding conceptual relationships in natural language.

## Current Status

**Production Implementation**: "The Cat" version deployed with GPU acceleration and web-based interface, demonstrating successful real-time semantic space mapping and neural cascade simulation.

## Research Impact

This work advances the state-of-the-art in computational semantics by providing scalable alternatives to traditional methods while maintaining interpretability through advanced visualization techniques.
