## Our Philosophy

**Communication & Science** is a peer reviewed online journal focusing on the scientific study of communication processes. 

### Founding Principles
The founding philosophy of the journal is that there is only one scientific method for both physical and social sciences. 

**Special social science methods** such as categorical scaling, hypothesis testing, nonmetric analyses, ordinal scales and the like are discouraged. 

### Measurement Standards
In articles based on data, **precise measurement is expected** and estimates of the precision of measurements is required. 

**Inferential statistics are discouraged**, but precise measurements of sample statistics are required. Rather than inferential statistics, **replication is strongly encouraged**. Exact replications of previous work are especially solicited.

### Scope
Theoretical, philosophical and historical articles are also welcome. Older works, either unpublished or not readily available, are welcome as part of the **Classics series**.

### Publication Model
Since printing is not required, there is no need for issues, volumes, numbers and the like. Each accepted article will be **published when ready**, and identified by the date received and the date posted. 

Since there are no printing costs, there is no need for authors to assign their rights to the journal; **authors retain all rights**, including the right to ask for an article to be withdrawn.

### Submission Guidelines
**No special citation format** (e.g., APA, MLA, etc.) is required, as long as it is easily posted to the web. Innovation is encouraged. Manuscripts saved as **.pdf files** are particularly easy for us to publish, and so will likely appear earlier.

Work should be submitted to the editor you believe is most likely to have the knowledge necessary to understand and evaluate it expertly. 

### About RAH Press
RAH Press is the publication area of the Galileo Company. It is named after **Richard A. Holmes**, who was the primary programmer of Galileo software until his untimely demise.

### Our Core Mission
Finally, *Communication & Science* is about **communication**. Of course, publication in a serious journal like *Communication & Science* is a mark of respect, but the purpose of publishing in *Communication & Science* is to **communicate your observations to others, who must check them**. 

When preparing submissions, authors should find ways to communicate the theories which led them to carry out the research, the exact methods by which the observations were made, the results of the observations and the degree of uncertainty around the observations in a way most clearly understandable by readers of *Communication and Science*. A well written article will make it possible for a reader to **reproduce the original work and check it**.
