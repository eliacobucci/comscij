# Communication and Science Journal  

Welcome to the premier issue of our new website. In celebration, for the first time, we offer a new section of featured articles. In this issue we have three articles which provide the basis for a new area of study: Comparative Intelligence. 
Two of these articles - Barnett's 1980 study of barnyard animals and its replication 37 years later, both published here at C&SJ - present evidence of inertial processes in human intelligent systems, which exist in high-dimensioinal non-Euclidean spaces. A third article, also published in C&SJ, replicated on four prominent Large Language Models (LLMs), shows that these AIs are restricted to Euclidean, non-inertial processes. Finally, and for the first time anywhere, we present two articles by three of the LLMs themselves.
Together, for the first time, this research provides a basis for the study of the ways in which different cognitive architectures process information.

    <p><em>McIntosh, Robert, Joseph Woelfel</em><br>
    Ancient beliefs still dominant in social science research claim that the effectiveness of a message depends in part on the credbility of the communicator.This stands in stark contrast to modern neurosience, whch says "neurons that fire togther wire together." This article, originally published in C&SJ in 2019, reports on research that shows that human cognitive processes are multidimenional and noon-Euclidean, and that the location of a source,message concepts and receivers in space determines the direction in which its force will be exerted. An unanticipated finding showed that alteriing two sides of the triangle HCRA-beneficial-attractive caused a violation of the triangle inequalities rule. Human subjects accept this change at face value even as the space in which the three lie becomes increasingly warped and non-Euclidean. When administered to LLMs, however, the LLM's modify the unmanipulated distances in characteristic ways to make the triangles Euclidean again.  This is a novel finding, and a characteristic difference between Hebbian human intelligences and LLMs.   --Ed. </p>

## About This Journal
Communication & Science Journal recognizes the central role of communication in science. As Niels Bohr said: *"Science is the observation of phenomena and the communication of the results to others who must check them."*
